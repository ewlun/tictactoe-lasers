# Tic-tac-toe with lasers

## Rules
The goal is to get three in a row, just like regular tic-tac-toe. The twist is that there are lasers.

### Lasers
A player can shoot a laser between two of their marks, burning the tiles and marks between them. A mark cannot be placed on a burned tile.

### Mirrors
Mirrors can be placed to divert lasers. A mirror can be placed either in two ways: / and \ . (might be changed)
